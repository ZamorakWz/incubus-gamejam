**_Game Jam Project:_ Incubus**

For BUG Spring Jam 2024, our team of 5 created a mid-poly horror game with an isometric camera in just 2 days. The team consisted of:

- Game Designer

- 2 Game Developers (Programmers)

- Narrative Designer

- 3D Artist

As one of the two developers, I was responsible for several key mechanics:

- Camera System: Implemented an isometric perspective camera that follows the player.

- Camera Controls: Added functionality for camera zoom in/out, camera shake, and camera fade in/out effects.

- Player Movement System: Developed using NavMesh for smooth navigation.

- Enemy AI: Created a simple enemy AI. Initially aimed to use a State Machine pattern but utilized Enums due to time constraints.

- Basic Animation Implementation: Integrated basic animations for game elements.

This project was an intense and rewarding experience, allowing us to rapidly prototype and collaborate effectively under tight deadlines.
